# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, There

I'm John Kindem, come from China and graduated from NUAA in 2019. I work for HUAWEI and my daily work is something about Graphics & Game.

By the way, I am also goot at Web, Android, etc. When topic turn to 'what language you use', I will answer that many, but what I most like is C++ and Java.

I like the feel when coding attentively. Every time I catch a new idea, I want to implement and share it.

Excepting that making new friend and cooperating with them.
